# Daily Workflow

A typical CSM day might look like:

1. First thirty to sixty minutes: Inbox and customer relationship management
   - Respond to customer emails, especially where they are blocked.
   - Scan health and usage notifications or alerts from your customer success tool.
   - Update or create tasks based on incoming information.

2. Meeting Preparation: Micro preparation for each call
   - For each call:
     - Review last meeting notes using QDIA.
     - Check current usage and health.
     - Draft a simple three point agenda.
     - Have relevant dashboards, tickets, and documents open.

3. Customer Calls
   - Run the call with:
     - Clear opening with agenda and time check.
     - Focused discussion mapped to outcomes.
     - Clear next steps and owner.
   - Take notes using the QDIA framework.

4. Post Call Follow Up
   - Send a brief recap:
     - Decisions made.
     - Action items with who and when.
     - Any links or resources promised.
   - Log notes and tasks into customer relationship management.

5. Proactive Outreach Block
   - Choose one to three accounts per day:
     - Review their usage and health.
     - Send a proactive note with:
       - Observations.
       - Suggestions.
       - An offer to connect.

6. Learning or Deep Work
   - Use your designated learning block (from your weekly operating rhythm) to:
      - Explore new product features.
      - Read a relevant article or internal document.
      - Practice a new workflow you might show customers.
   These blocks are scheduled periods for deeper learning, separate from any urgent learning you may need to do in    the moment.
