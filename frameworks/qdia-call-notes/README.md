# QDIA Call Notes

A simple, fast system for structuring call notes. During a call, capture notes using four primary markers:

- Q — Question  
  Customer or internal question worth remembering.  
  Example: Q – Alerting thresholds for critical events

- D — Discussion  
  Key discussion topics and themes.  
  Example: D – Long term roadmap for automating reporting

- I — Issue  
  Problems, bugs, blockers, or points of confusion.  
  Example: I – Integration failing between platform and security information and event management

- A — Action  
  Concrete action items with owner and due date when possible.  
  Example: A – Send step by step integration guide by Thursday

Optional additional markers:

- F — Feedback  
  Product feedback, user experience comments, requests.

- W — Win  
  Positive outcomes or success moments worth capturing.

## After the Call

- Log D and Q in your customer relationship management system as meeting notes.
- Log I into support or product channels as needed.
- Convert A items into tasks with dates.
- Add F and W to relevant internal channels such as product feedback and wins.
