# AI Companion System

Use an AI assistant such as ChatGPT as a CSM copilot to accelerate understanding and communication. This system has three phases.

## Phase 1 - Stakeholder Map

Goal: Identify who matters inside the customer organization.

Prompt skeleton:

"I'm a Customer Success Manager for a [type of product or platform] that helps companies with [primary use case].

Our solution delivers these outcomes:
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]
- [Outcome 4]

Help me build a stakeholder map. Include anyone who might be influenced by our product, who might have a project that touches our product, or anyone who might be involved in the buying committee. Which stakeholders and departments should I prioritize for relationship building to ensure successful adoption and expansion?"

Use this to identify roles like:
- Executive sponsor
- Economic buyer
- Champions
- Administrators and power users
- Adjacent teams affected by the product

## Phase 2 - Stakeholder Motivations

Goal: Understand what each persona cares about.

Prompt skeleton:

"For each of those stakeholders, please summarize the following in a table, one stakeholder per row:
- What business outcomes and metrics matter most to this stakeholder
- How they typically measure success
- Common challenges they face
- How our solution addresses these challenges
- What risks might cause them to disengage or question our value"

This becomes your persona cheat sheet.

## Phase 3 - Tailored Communication

Goal: Generate role specific and value focused messaging.

Prompt skeleton:

"Using the stakeholder table we created, generate four communication templates:

1. An introduction email for a new stakeholder explaining our partnership vision
2. A Quarterly Business Review summary email highlighting value delivered to their department
3. An at risk account message addressing potential adoption challenges
4. An expansion opportunity message tied to their business objectives

For each template:
- Open with a specific pain point or opportunity relevant to their role
- Acknowledge their current approach and its limitations
- Explain how our solution delivers unique value for their situation
- Include a clear next step

Keep each message under one hundred fifty words, easily scannable, and jargon free."

You can then lightly edit the outputs to match:
- Your tone
- Your product
- Your customer context
