## Phase 1 - Stakeholder Map

Goal: Identify who matters inside the customer organization.

Prompt skeleton:

I'm a Customer Success Manager for a [type of product or platform] that helps companies with [primary use case].

Our solution delivers these outcomes:

[Outcome 1]  
[Outcome 2]  
[Outcome 3]  
[Outcome 4]

Help me build a stakeholder map. Include anyone who might be influenced by our product, who might have a project that touches our product, or anyone who might be involved in the buying committee. Which stakeholders and departments should I prioritize for relationship building to ensure successful adoption and expansion?"

Use this to identify roles like:

- Executive sponsor  
- Economic buyer  
- Champions  
- Administrators and power users  
- Adjacent teams affected by the product

## Phase 2 - Stakeholder Motivations

Goal: Understand what each persona cares about.

**This table represents the structured version of the stakeholder map created in Phase 1.**

Prompt skeleton:

For each of those stakeholders, please summarize the following points in tabular format, with each point as a column header and each stakeholder as its row:

- What business outcomes and metrics matter most to this stakeholder  
- How this stakeholder typically measures success in their role  
- Common challenges this stakeholder faces when trying to achieve their goals  
- How our solution specifically addresses these challenges and supports their success metrics  
- What risks might cause this stakeholder to disengage or question our value

## Phase 3 - Tailored Communication

Goal: Generate role specific and value focused messaging.

Prompt skeleton:

Using the stakeholder table we created, generate four communication templates:

- An introduction email for a new stakeholder explaining our partnership vision  
- A QBR summary highlighting value delivered to their specific department  
- An at-risk account message addressing potential adoption challenges  
- An expansion opportunity message tied to their business objectives  

For each template:

- Open with a specific pain point or opportunity relevant to their role  
- Acknowledge their current approach and its limitations  
- Explain how our solution delivers unique value for their situation  
- Include a clear next step or action item  
- Keep it under 150 words and easily scannable  
- Use straightforward, jargon-free language.  

You can then lightly edit the outputs to match:

- Your tone  
- Your product  
- Your customer context
