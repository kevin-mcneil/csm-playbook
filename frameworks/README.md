# Frameworks

This section contains the core systems used to structure calls, notes, communication, and understanding of customer environments. These frameworks help a customer success manager stay consistent, organized, and focused on driving customer outcomes.

The following frameworks are included:

- [QDIA Call Notes](./qdia-call-notes/README.md)
- [AI Companion System](./ai-companion-system/README.md)

Each framework contains the complete content in its own folder.
