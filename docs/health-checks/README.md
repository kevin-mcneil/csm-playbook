# Health Checks

This section outlines how to evaluate, interpret, and act on customer health signals using a structured, outcome oriented approach. Customer health is monitored continuously, with emphasis on early risk detection and rapid corrective action.

---

# Core Principle

Relentlessly monitor and manage customer health.  
Health is not a single metric. It is a behavior and an ongoing discipline that combines operational signals, customer experience signals, and outcome alignment.

---

# Health Categories

Customer health is composed of three interconnected dimensions.

## 1. Operational Health
Indicators of product utilization and technical engagement:

- Usage trends  
- Feature adoption  
- Login frequency  
- Configuration hygiene  

Operational changes often provide the earliest quantitative signal of risk.

---

## 2. Experience Health
Indicators of day to day friction and sentiment:

- Ticket volume  
- Recurring support patterns  
- Responsiveness  
- Implementation blockers  
- New user onboarding issues  

Experience issues do not always represent churn risk, but they always represent frustration.

---

## 3. Outcome Health
Indicators of whether the customer is achieving the business outcomes they purchased the product for:

- Progress toward expected outcomes  
- Alignment on goals  
- Delivery of value milestones  

Outcome misalignment is the strongest predictor of long term dissatisfaction.

---

# Early Risk Indicators

Two signals consistently precede churn risk.

### Usage decline
A sharp 25 to 30 percent drop in usage or adoption often indicates loss of value or workflow change.

### Ticket spike
Three to four support tickets in a short period typically indicate friction that must be investigated.

These are signals, not diagnoses. When detected, they trigger immediate validation and engagement.

---

# Usage Decline Response Process

When a usage decline is detected:

1. Validate the drop  
   Determine whether the decline deviates from the customer’s historical pattern.

2. Check for friction signals  
   Support tickets, blockers, staffing changes, outages, onboarding issues.

3. Engage immediately  
   Contact the customer to review the trend and discuss any workflow or organizational changes.

4. Diagnose root causes  
   Possible factors include:  
   - Loss of a champion  
   - Misalignment between stakeholders  
   - Misunderstood workflows  
   - Feature not delivering expected value  
   - Workflow changes or competing priorities  

5. Reset the adoption plan  
   Build a short, achievable adoption plan with clear milestones and ensure leadership alignment.

6. Monitor closely  
   Track usage daily or weekly depending on severity and update stakeholders regularly.

The goal is to reconnect usage to the outcome the customer purchased the platform for.

# Ticket Spike Response Process

When ticket volume increases rapidly:

1. Identify patterns  
   Look for:  
   - Repeated issues  
   - Misconfiguration  
   - Workflow misunderstanding  
   - Lack of training  
   - New users onboarding  
   - Performance issues  

2. Coordinate internally  
   Ensure support and engineering are aware that the spike may impact renewal or customer sentiment.

3. Check sentiment with the customer  
   Example:  
   "I noticed a few issues came up this month. I want to make sure we are supporting you and understand how this is impacting your objectives."

Tickets are not the problem. The perception of friction is the problem. That is what must be addressed.

# Red and Yellow Account Recovery

Recovering a red or yellow account requires three steps.

1. Diagnose the truth  
   Collect signals: usage, sentiment, alignment, open issues, value gaps.

2. Reset expectations and build a corrective plan  
   Align with leadership on:  
   - The outcomes they expect  
   - How far the account is from those outcomes  
   - What corrective actions are required  
   Develop a 30 to 60 day recovery plan with clear responsibilities and timelines.

3. Tighten engagement  
   Weekly syncs, milestone tracking, early wins, user training, targeted adoption.

Customers do not churn because a metric is red.  
They churn when a red metric stays red without leadership visibility or a plan.

---

# Health Review Call Structure

A Health Review Call is tactical and focused on correction. Recommended structure:

1. Context  
   "I want to discuss a few trends I am seeing and make sure we keep you on track for your goals."

2. Signals  
   - Usage drop  
   - Ticket patterns  
   - Adoption gaps  
   - Milestone progress  

3. Diagnosis discussion  
   Ask:  
   "Does this reflect what you are seeing internally"  
   "What changed on your side recently"

4. Impact  
   Tie the trend directly to expected outcomes.

5. Corrective plan  
   Create a 30 to 60 day plan with owners, milestones, and timelines.

6. Agreement and next steps  
   Align on the plan and establish a follow up cadence.

---

# Communicating Health to Executives

Executives want meaning, not metrics. Communicate health at the business level:

- What outcome the customer expected  
- What outcome they are currently receiving  
- What risk exists  
- What corrective actions are underway  
- What leadership help is required  

Use simple, direct language tied to business value.

---

# Health and Forecasting

Health is the earliest predictor of renewal risk and should be incorporated into forecasting.

A simple model:

- Green. Strong usage, hitting milestones, achieving outcomes.  
- Yellow. Early friction, adoption gaps, unclear value.  
- Red. Declining usage, repeated tickets, misalignment, stalled outcomes.  

Risk levels should be assigned 60 to 90 days before renewal to allow time for recovery.

---

# What Relentless Monitoring Means

Relentless monitoring means treating customer health as continuous behavior, not a dashboard.

It includes:

- Identifying risks before the customer raises them  
- Diagnosing early  
- Aligning quickly  
- Building corrective plans  
- Keeping leadership informed  
- Ensuring customers stay on track for the outcomes they purchased  

Health is the engine behind retention, adoption, and expansion, and should be treated as the center of the customer lifecycle.
